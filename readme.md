   BrowserMob Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture HTTP content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BMP works well as a standalone proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium tests.

   The latest version of BrowserMob Proxy is 2.1.5, powered by LittleProxy.

   If you're running BrowserMob Proxy within a Java application or Selenium test, get started with Embedded Mode. If you want to run BMP from the command line as a standalone proxy, start with Standalone.
